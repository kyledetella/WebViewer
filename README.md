WebviewTester
=============

This project my exploration into building a native iOS app using [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and is under _active_ development.

## Background

When writing JavaScript libraries, testing for specific cases in WebViews on iOS and Android proves rather difficult. WebviewTester aims to improve the debugging and testing story in this domain.

## Setup

This is built using [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/), there are helpful walkthroughs and demos to help get you started [here](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).


First, install the dependencies and start [React packager](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packager) (typically, when you click "Build and then run..." in XCode, this command will automatically run. However, I have found it easier to run this task myself).

```
npm i && npm start
```

Open XCode and clieck the "Build" button. This will launch the iOS simulator and you will be on your way.

## To do

- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Finish styling
- [ ] Create a more powerful "address entry" UI to allow for detailed options
- [ ] Add ability to save screenshots
